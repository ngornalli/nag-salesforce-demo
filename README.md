# When you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. 
# They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed. 
# Git tracks these files, and keeps track of your history by organizing your files and changes in three trees. 
# They are working, staging (also called index), and history. 
# Branch new-branch-2
# When we add, delete, and make changes to files, we do this in the working tree.
